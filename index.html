        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Hudhayfah Bacchus. I am currently an English teacher in Saudi Arabia.
          I have been teaching English for more than 4 years now. Teaching has always been my passion but <br> as time goes by and situations change,
          I need to develop myself and continue to learn so that I can be the best employee possible and hence can comfortably look after and support my family.
          So, I decided to get an MBA and <br> it was an amazing experience. I assumed at that time that I would be done with school until I decided to have a cup of coffee
          with my cousin. We talked about future careers and thats when he introduced me to the idea <br> of becoming a webdeveloper.
          At first I brushed off the idea because the thought of me coding was very intimidating.
          But then he broke it down for me and explained why I would be a good webdev, I decided to give it a try. <br> A few weeks later, and I can proudly say that this website
          is the first thing I created. I am super excited to learn more. Let's go!</p>
